So[Beat] this the village[,] boss?[A]

[MidLeft]
Aye[,] it fits the bill.[A]

[MidRight]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
So[Beat] we just head in and[N]
and round up the slav-[A]


[MidLeft]
That won't be necessary[.][N]
I'll handle this one myself.[AN]
You fools can keep watch and make[N]
sure no one interrupts my fun![A]

[MidRight]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
O-oh[,] right boss.[A] Just don't[N]
cause too much ruckus in there - we[N]
don't need that lordling who's been[N]
snooping around catching wind of us.[A]

[MidLeft]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
Tell me[,] Glove[,] who's the[N]
brains of this outfit?[A]

[MidRight]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[Beat]You are.[A]

[MidLeft]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
Correct[.][N]

Not you.[A][N]

Pompous bastard[,] always hogging the glory.[AN]
You heard him boys[!] Stand watch[,] and[N]
keep your eyes sharp for that lordling![AN]
If anything gets in your way, cut it[N]
down before it has the chance to shout![A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadAudrey]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
So[,] Wesley[,] it appears this [N]
area is the target of the slavers'[N]
next attack after all.[A]

[MidRight]
Indeed[.] It seems they've entrenched[N]
themselves deep within the valley[.][N]
What are your orders[,] Princess Audrey?[A]

[MidLeft]
Our reinforcements are still a few moments[N]
away[,] but if we wait any longer[,] their[N]
main force could slip away.[AN]
It's best we engage the slavers now[N]
before they slip through our fingers.[A]

[MidRight]
With all due respect[,] your Highness[,][N]
are you certain[?] You've trained[N]
for this[,] but true combat-[A]

[MidLeft]
-is nothing like sparring with dummies[.][N]
I know Wesley[,] and by the goddess[,][N]
Cordell never lets me forget it[.][AN]
But he believes I'm ready[,] and today[N]
seems as good a day as any to prove it.[AN]
Besides[,] I doubt my conscience will be[N]
too troubled[,] given the filth we're[N]
dealing with.[A]

[MidRight]
I see your mind is set. I've[N]
known you long enough to know[N]
there's no swaying you now.[AN]
Very well[,] let us give these[N]
slavers the justice they deserve![AN]
But remember[,] our reinforcements[N]
are not far behind. Don't stray[N]
too far ahead![A]

Elder[!] A lone[N]
visitor has arrived![A]

[Right][LoadVillager1]
Hail[,] traveller[.] What business[N]
brings you to Gorien?[A]

[MidLeft][LoadFester]
The name's Fester[.] I'm but a[N]
humble[Beat]merchant[,] of sorts.[AN]
I've come to your village in the hopes[N]
of procuring some goods for my trade.[A]

[Right]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
You'll find little here worth trading[.][N]
Our harvest is meagre[,] and[N]
the seasons have not been kind.[A]

[MidLeft]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
Oh[,] I'm not after crops or trinkets[.][N]
My interests lie elsewhere.[AN]
I've heard whispers that you're[N]
sheltering Felean refugees.[A]

[Right][MoveMidRight]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
You[Beat]you're a slaver![A]

[MidLeft]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
I prefer "merchant[,]" but let's not[N]
split hairs[.] I'd rather conduct our[N]
business without any[Beat]unpleasantness.[A]

[FarRight]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
Should I call the militia?[A]

[MidRight]
[Beat][A]

[MidLeft]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
Since I'm feeling generous today[,][N]
I'll make it simple for you.[AN]
Hand over the Felean refugees in[N]
exchange for the safety of your village.[AN]
Not a single home need be touched[,][N]
not a single life need be lost.[AN]
A fair trade, don't you think?[A]

[MidRight][MoveRight]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
[Beat]Don't summon the militia.[A]

[MidLeft]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
Oh[?] I expected[N]
more resistance.[A]


[Right]
Gather the children-the ones who[N]
arrived a fortnight ago.[AN]
I won't gamble the lives of my people[N]
for the sake of a few refugees.[A]

[FarRight]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
A-as you wish[,] elder.[A]
[ClearFace]

[MidLeft]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
A wise choice[,] elder[.] I just knew[N]
we could come to an agreement![A][X]

[MidRight][LoadWesley]
[MidLeft][LoadAudrey]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
What was that sound?[A]

[MidRight]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
It sounded like a tree falling.[AN]
Perhaps the enemy is cutting[N]
down thickets to cross[N]
cross the river and outflank us.[A]

[Left]
I thought this was a small slaver[N]
band[!] How do they have the men to[N]
coordinate such a manoeuvre?[A]

[FarFarLeft]
Lady Audrey, I expected you to[N]
remember the first rule of tactics[:][N]
Never underestimate your foe.[A][X]

Osborne[!] Elaine[!] I'm[N]
relieved you've caught up![A]

[Left]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
As am I[,] milady[,] though I must[N]
say[,] the plan we agreed upon[N]
has[Beat]unraveled somewhat.[AN]
Did I not counsel patience[,][N]
to wait until our forces were[N]
fully assembled before striking?[A]


[MidRight]
Yes[,] but once we arrived[,] the[N]
slavers had already established[N]
themselves in the valley.[AN]
I thought it best to act swiftly[,][N]
rather than risk letting them[N]
slip through our grasp.[A]

[Left]
Hmm[,] understandable[Beat]but[N]
a dangerous play[.][AN]
I doubt King Leland would be pleased[N]
to hear his daughter gambled her safety[N]
on her very first day of battle.[A]

[FarLeft]
She knew reinforcements were coming[,] so[N]
let's not dwell on it[!] What matters now[N]
is that we've got her back![A]

[MidRight]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
Well said[,] Elaine! Now let's rid[N]
this valley of the slaver scourge![A]

That went well[!] The villagers[N]
didn't so much as blink while I[N]
went about my business![A]

[MidLeft]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
Looks like you've caught [N]
some fresh meat![A]

them to speak to sell them![A]

[MidLeft]
Heh[,] true enough.[AN]
Now that you're here[,] though[,][N]
I heard trees coming down.[AN]
Some of our boys might be[N]
tangling with that lordling.[A]

[Right]
And this concerns me[N]
how[,] exactly?[A]

[MidLeft]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
Aren't you going to help?[A]

[Right]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
Oh[,] Glove[,] your memory fails you![N]
My task was to gather slaves from[N]
the village - at any cost.[AN]
Your task is to keep me safe at all[N]
costs[.] So[,] naturally[,] I must return[N]
to base with my prize.[AN]
You[,] however[,] should be dealing[N]
with that lordling and her knights[.][N]
Try to keep them off my back.[A]

[MidLeft]
[BoxHeight][0x1]
O-oh.[A]

[Right]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
What's the problem[?] You've got[N]
near twenty men at your command.[AN]
One simple lordling and a handful[N]
of knights shouldn't trouble you.[AN]
Honestly[,] Glove[,] have a little[N]
more confidence.[A]

[MidLeft]
R-right[.] Well[,]  I'll see you[N]
back at the base[,] then.[A]

That's more like it[.][N]

sticking around to face Cordell's [N]
knights.[AN]
Let's hope Glove can at[N]
least keep them off my trail.[AN]
Come now[,] boys! You're worth[N]
