So[Beat] we just head in and[N]

[MidLeft]
That won't be necessary[.][N]
I'll handle this one myself.[AN]
You fools can keep watch and make[N]
sure no one interrupts my fun![A]

[MidRight]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
O-oh[,] right boss.[AN]
Just don't cause too much ruckus in there -[N]
we don't need that lordling who's been[N]
snooping around catching wind of us.[A]

So[,] Wesley[,] it appears this [N]
area is the target of the slavers'[N]
next attack after all.[A]

[MidRight]
Indeed[.] It seems they've entrenched[N]
themselves deep within the valley[.][N]
What are your orders[,] Princess Audrey?[A]

[MidLeft]
Our reinforcements are still a few moments[N]
away[,] but if we wait any longer[,] their[N]
main force could slip away.[AN]
It's best we engage the slavers now[N]
before they slip through our fingers.[A]

[MidRight]
With all due respect[,] your Highness[,][N]
are you certain[?] You've trained[N]
for this[,] but true combat -[A]

[MidLeft]
- is nothing like sparring with dummies[.][N]
I know Wesley[,] and by the goddess[,][N]
Cordell never lets me forget it[.][AN]
But he believes I'm ready[,] and today[N]
seems as good a day as any to prove it.[AN]
Besides[,] I doubt my conscience will be[N]
too troubled[,] given the filth we're[N]
dealing with.[A]

[MidRight]
I see your mind is set. I've[N]
known you long enough to know[N]
there's no swaying you now.[AN]
Very well[,] let us give these[N]
slavers the justice they deserve![AN]
But remember[,] our reinforcements[N]
are not far behind. Don't stray[N]

The name's Fester[.] I'm but a[N]

I've come to your village in the hopes[N]
of procuring some goods for my trade.[A]

[Right]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
You'll find little here worth trading[.][N]
Our harvest is meagre[,] and[N]
the seasons have not been kind.[A]

[MidLeft]
[BoxHeight][0x2]
Oh[,] I'm not after crops or trinkets[.][N]
My interests lie elsewhere.[AN]
I've heard whispers that you're[N]

Hand over the Felean refugees in[N]

A fair trade, don't you think?[A]

Gather the children - the ones who[N]

[BoxHeight][0x1]
What was that sound?[A]

[MidRight]
[BoxHeight][0x3]
It sounded like a tree falling.[AN]
Perhaps the enemy is cutting[N]
down thickets to cross[N]
cross the river and outflank us.[A]

[Left]
I thought this was a small slaver[N]
band[!] How do they have the men to[N]
coordinate such a manoeuvre?[A]

As am I[,] milady[,] though I must[N]
say[,] the plan we agreed upon[N]
has[Beat]unraveled somewhat.[AN]
Did I not counsel patience[,][N]
to wait until our forces were[N]
fully assembled before striking?[A]


[MidRight]
Yes[,] but once we arrived[,] the[N]
slavers had already established[N]
themselves in the valley.[AN]
I thought it best to act swiftly[,][N]
rather than risk letting them[N]
slip through our grasp.[A]

[Left]
Hmm[,] understandable[Beat]but[N]
a dangerous play[.][AN]
I doubt King Leland would be pleased[N]
to hear his daughter gambled her safety[N]

She knew reinforcements were coming[,] so[N]
let's not dwell on it[!] What matters now[N]

Aren't you going to help?[A]

My task was to gather slaves from[N]
the village - at any cost.[AN]
Your task is to keep me safe at all[N]
costs[.] So[,] naturally[,] I must return[N]

What if our people had died[N]

By giving them to that slaver,[N]
you've condemned those children[N]

The two children those bandits kidnapped[N]
arrived in our village a fortnight ago.[AN]
They stated they were part of a merchant[N]

wandering the countryside for many days.[AN]
After hearing their tale[,] I offered to[N]
care for them[.] However[,] many of the[N]
